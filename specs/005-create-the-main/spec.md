# Feature Specification: Main Game Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `005-create-the-main`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create the main game dashboard. The dashboard must be the central hub for the player and have an event-driven and character-focused feel. It must display four key stats at all times: Approval Rating, Party Treasury, Seats in Parliament, and the Current In-Game Date. The primary player interactions will be through a map of the Netherlands for managing regional campaigns, a list of parliamentary bills for voting, a calendar for scheduling events, and a news feed for reacting to events. The game time must pass automatically, with controls to pause and change the speed."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What time speed options should be available to players? ‚Üí A: Basic speeds: 1x, 2x, 4x
- Q: What types of events should trigger dashboard updates or notifications? ‚Üí A: All events plus social: Media coverage, public reactions, party member activities
- Q: What information should be shown for parliamentary bills? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive: Full text, summary, party position, consequences, public opinion, coalition stance, voting deadline
- Q: What specific actions should players be able to take in regional campaign management? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive: Fund allocation, candidate selection, strategy setting, rally scheduling, local policy positions
- Q: What types of responses should be available for news feed events? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive: Ignore, public statement, private action, coalition consultation, emergency legislation, media campaign

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a political party leader, I need a central dashboard that gives me immediate visibility into my party's status and allows me to manage all key political activities in one place. The dashboard should feel like a command center where I can monitor my approval rating, manage finances, track parliamentary representation, respond to current events, and strategically plan campaigns across the Netherlands.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I open the game, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I can see all four key stats (Approval Rating, Party Treasury, Seats in Parliament, Current Date) clearly displayed at all times
2. **Given** I'm on the dashboard, **When** I interact with the Netherlands map, **Then** I can access regional campaign management for different provinces
3. **Given** there are pending parliamentary bills, **When** I access the bills list, **Then** I can review and vote on legislation
4. **Given** I want to plan my political activities, **When** I open the calendar, **Then** I can schedule events and see upcoming commitments
5. **Given** current events are happening, **When** I check the news feed, **Then** I can see relevant political news and choose how to respond
6. **Given** the game is running, **When** time passes automatically, **Then** I can see the date advance and can pause or change the speed of time progression

### Edge Cases
- **Approval Rating Thresholds**: When approval rating ‚â§ 15%, trigger crisis mode with urgent notifications; when ‚â• 85%, unlock special campaign opportunities
- **Treasury Management**: When treasury < 0, disable funding-dependent actions and display debt warning; when treasury < -50,000, trigger emergency fundraising event
- **Event Prioritization**: High-priority events (urgency_level = CRITICAL) must display modal notifications that pause time automatically until acknowledged
- **Speed Transition Behavior**: Time speed changes must complete current time increment before applying new speed; UI must show 200ms transition animation between speeds

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display four key stats (Approval Rating, Party Treasury, Seats in Parliament, Current In-Game Date) prominently and persistently on the dashboard
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an interactive map of the Netherlands for regional campaign management access
- **FR-003**: System MUST present a list of current parliamentary bills available for voting
- **FR-004**: System MUST include a calendar interface for scheduling and viewing political events

- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain an event-driven feel by triggering dashboard updates for political events (bill deadlines, elections, crises), game mechanics (stat changes, time milestones), and social activities (media coverage, public reactions, party member activities)
- **FR-010**: System MUST reflect character-focused gameplay through character portraits with relationship indicators showing trust levels and political alignment
- **FR-011**: Dashboard MUST serve as the central hub with all game features accessible through tabbed interfaces that provide detailed views behind the main dashboard overview

- **FR-015**: News feed responses MUST allow comprehensive response options including ignore, public statement, private action, coalition consultation, emergency legislation, and media campaign
