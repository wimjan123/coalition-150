# Feature Specification: Player and Party Creation Flow

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-the-player`
**Created**: 2025-01-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement the player and party creation flow. This includes adding a 'Load Game' button to the main menu. After a player clicks 'Start Game', they should be taken to a new screen. This screen must allow the player to either select a pre-existing character and party or create a new custom character and party. The creation process must include options for party name, a slogan, a primary party color, and a selection of logos. The flow concludes with the player's first media interview, where they must respond to a series of questions from a journalist."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new player launches the single-player political game and wants to create their political party to begin their campaign against AI opponents. They navigate from the main menu through character and party creation, customizing their party's identity with full political profiles, and complete their first media interview to establish their public persona before entering the main campaign.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a player is on the main menu, **When** they click "Start Game", **Then** they are taken to a character/party selection screen
2. **Given** a player is on the selection screen, **When** they choose "Create New", **Then** they can customize their character and party details
3. **Given** a player is creating a party, **When** they enter party name, slogan, select color and logo, **Then** all customizations are saved for their party
4. **Given** a player has completed party creation, **When** they proceed, **Then** they are presented with a media interview scenario
5. **Given** a player is in a media interview, **When** they answer all journalist questions, **Then** they complete the creation flow and enter the main game
6. **Given** a returning player is on the main menu, **When** they click "Load Game", **Then** they can select from their existing saved characters/parties

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player tries to create a party with an empty name or slogan?
- How does the system handle duplicate party names?
- What happens if a player exits during the creation process - is progress saved?
- How does the system handle a player who doesn't respond to interview questions?
