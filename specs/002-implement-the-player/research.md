# Phase 0: Research Findings

## Godot 4.5 Custom Resource System

### Decision: Use Custom Resource Classes for Data Persistence
**Rationale**: Godot's Resource system provides built-in serialization, Inspector integration, and optimal performance for save/load operations.

**Key Findings from Context7**:
- Custom Resources extend the base `Resource` class with `@export` variables
- Resources automatically serialize to `.tres` files using `ResourceSaver.save()`
- Load resources using `load()` or `ResourceLoader.load()`
- Resources support complex data types including sub-resources and arrays

**Best Practices**:
- Use `@export` for all properties that need persistence
- Provide default parameter constructors for Inspector integration
- Resources are automatically reference-counted and memory managed

**Alternatives Considered**: JSON files, ConfigFile, raw file I/O
**Rejected Because**: Resources provide type safety, Inspector integration, and automatic serialization without custom parsing logic

## Scene Management and Autoloads

### Decision: SceneManager Autoload for Global Scene Transitions
**Rationale**: Autoloads provide global access and persist across scene changes, perfect for managing transitions.

**Key Findings**:
- Autoloads are registered in project settings and initialized at startup
- Use `get_tree().change_scene_to_file()` for simple transitions
- Use `get_tree().change_scene_to_packed()` for cached scenes
- Can implement custom transition effects with fade overlays

**Implementation Pattern**:
```gdscript
# SceneManager.gd (Autoload)
extends Node

func change_scene_with_transition(scene_path: String):
    # Fade out -> Load scene -> Fade in
    pass
```

## UI Architecture

### Decision: Control-based UI with Theme System
**Rationale**: Consistent with Coalition 150's existing UI architecture and supports accessibility.

**Key Findings**:
- Use Control nodes for all UI elements
- Godot's Theme system provides consistent styling
- VBoxContainer/HBoxContainer for automatic layout
- ColorPicker node available for custom color selection

**Theme Integration**:
- Create `player_creation_theme.tres` resource
- Apply theme at root Control node level
- All child nodes inherit theme properties automatically

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: GUT Framework with Scene Testing
**Rationale**: GUT is the established testing framework in the project constitution.

**Testing Approach**:
- Unit tests for Resource classes (PlayerData, CharacterData, PartyData)
- Integration tests for scene interactions and SceneManager
- Contract tests for scene interface compliance

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Resource Pooling and Asynchronous Loading
**Rationale**: Meet constitutional requirements for 60 FPS and <100ms scene transitions.

**Optimizations**:
- Preload frequently used scenes as PackedScene resources
- Use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` for large scenes (if needed)
- Implement object pooling for interview question UI elements
- Scene transitions under constitutional limit of 100ms

## Save System Architecture

### Decision: User Directory with Resource Files
**Rationale**: Godot's `user://` directory provides cross-platform save location.

**Save Strategy**:
- Save to `user://save_data/` directory
- Each save as individual `.tres` file
- Check `FileAccess.file_exists()` for Load Game button state
- Use ResourceSaver flags for compression if needed

## Interview System

### Decision: Dynamic Question Generation with Template System
**Rationale**: Supports requirement for 5 questions based on character profile.

**Architecture**:
- Question template resources with placeholders
- Character data drives question selection logic
- Multiple choice answers stored as string arrays
- Simple UI with Label for question, Buttons for answers

## Constitutional Compliance

### All Requirements Met:
- **Scene-First**: ✅ Three modular scenes with clear responsibilities
- **GDScript Standards**: ✅ Style guide compliance, explicit typing planned
- **TDD**: ✅ GUT framework integration, Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Performance**: ✅ 60 FPS target, <100ms scene loading
- **UI Consistency**: ✅ Theme system integration planned
- **Documentation-First**: ✅ Context7 consultation completed, official patterns verified

**No Technical Debt**: All decisions align with constitutional principles without compromising requirements.
