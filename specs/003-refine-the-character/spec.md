## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player creating a character and political party in Coalition 150, I want to enter custom party names and slogans while selecting from 10 predefined character background options, so that I can personalize my party while ensuring character background consistency with the game's themes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the party creation screen, **When** I need to enter a party name, **Then** I can type a custom party name in a free text field
2. **Given** I have entered a party name, **When** I proceed to enter a slogan, **Then** I can type a custom slogan in a free text field
3. **Given** I am creating my character background, **When** I reach the background selection, **Then** I see exactly 10 preset background options and must choose one before proceeding
4. **Given** I have entered my party details and selected a background, **When** I complete the creation process, **Then** my character and party are created using my custom text and selected background preset
5. **Given** I have not selected a character background option, **When** I try to proceed, **Then** the system prevents me from continuing and highlights the missing background selection
6. **Given** I am viewing character background options, **When** I hover over or select a background option, **Then** I see both its difficulty rating and gameplay impact preview before confirming my choice

### Edge Cases
- **Bypass attempts**: System MUST enforce preset selection through UI validation - cannot proceed without selection
- **Unavailable presets**: System MUST provide fallback to default preset or graceful error handling if resource loading fails
- **Selection changes**: System MUST allow players to change preset selection before final confirmation (covered in FR-008)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain free text input fields for party name entry
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain free text input fields for party slogan entry
- **FR-003**: System MUST replace character background free text input with a preset selection interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide exactly 10 selectable character background options
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce selection of exactly one character background preset
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent progression until character background selection is made
- **FR-007**: System MUST display character background preset options ordered by gameplay difficulty from easiest to hardest
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow players to change their character background selection before final confirmation
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide character background presets that are both politically balanced and representative of Dutch political landscape, including 2 satirical options
- **FR-010**: System MUST store custom party name and slogan text along with selected background preset
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain the existing character creation flow progression
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear visual indication of which character background preset is currently selected
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT apply any validation rules to party name and slogan text fields (no length limits, content restrictions, or profanity filtering)
- **FR-014**: System MUST display both difficulty rating and gameplay impact preview for each character background option before selection

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
