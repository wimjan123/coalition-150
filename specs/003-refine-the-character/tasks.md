# Tasks: Refine Character and Party Creation with Preset Selection System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-refine-the-character/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Found: GDScript 2.0 (Godot 4.5), GUT framework, Resource-based architecture
   → Extract: Godot scene system, TDD with GUT, OptionButton integration
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: PresetOption, CharacterBackgroundPresets entities
   → contracts/: 3 interface files → contract test tasks
   → quickstart.md: 7 test scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Resource structure, UI modifications, theme integration
   → Tests: Contract tests, unit tests, integration tests from quickstart
   → Core: PresetOption resource, CharacterBackgroundPresets resource, scene modifications
   → Integration: Save/load system, validation, signal connections
   → Polish: Performance validation, accessibility testing, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Scene modifications = sequential (single .tscn file)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Godot project**: `scripts/`, `scenes/`, `assets/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Resources in `assets/data/` directory
- Test files in `tests/contract/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- Setup (T001-T003) before all other tasks
- Contract tests (T004-T006) before resource implementation (T016-T017)
- Resource classes (T016-T017) before sample data creation (T018)
- Sample data (T018) before UI modifications (T019-T021)
- UI modifications complete before logic integration (T022-T025)
- Logic integration before save/load integration (T026-T032)

### Parallel Opportunities
- All contract tests (T004-T006) can run simultaneously
- All unit tests (T007-T008) can run simultaneously
- All integration tests (T009-T015) can run simultaneously
- Resource classes (T016-T017) can be developed in parallel
- Save migration (T029) independent of other save/load tasks
- All polish tasks (T033-T041) can run simultaneously

## Constitutional Compliance Notes

- **Scene-First Architecture**: T019-T021 modify existing scenes maintaining modularity
- **TDD Mandatory**: T004-T015 create failing tests before T016+ implementation
- **Performance-First**: T033-T035 validate 60 FPS target and memory usage
- **UI Consistency**: T021 extends existing theme system
- **Documentation-First**: T002 uses GUT framework, T040 maintains documentation

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Verified before execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T006)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T016-T017 for PresetOption/CharacterBackgroundPresets)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T015 before T016+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent ([P] tasks work on different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Quickstart scenarios mapped to integration tests (T009-T015)
- [x] TDD workflow enforced (tests must fail before implementation)

## Notes

- **GUT Framework**: All test files use Godot's GUT testing framework
- **Resource Files**: .tres files are Godot's text resource format
- **Scene Modifications**: .tscn files require sequential editing (no parallel [P])
- **Signal System**: Godot's built-in signal system for UI event handling
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All tasks align with project constitution principles
- **Political Content**: T036-T037 ensure appropriate and balanced content
- **Migration Support**: T029 handles existing save file compatibility
