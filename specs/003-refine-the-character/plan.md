# Implementation Plan: Refine Character and Party Creation with Preset Selection System

**Branch**: `003-refine-the-character` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-refine-the-character/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Refine the existing character and party creation feature by replacing free text inputs with a hybrid approach: maintain free text for party name and slogan, but replace character background input with a preset selection system featuring 10 predefined options ordered by difficulty, including political balance and satirical elements. Implementation involves modifying existing Godot scenes to use OptionButton nodes and creating a new Resource file for preset data.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: GDScript 2.0 (Godot 4.5)
**Primary Dependencies**: Godot 4.5, GUT (Godot Unit Test) framework for testing
**Storage**: Godot Resource files (.tres) for preset data, user:// directory for save data persistence
**Testing**: GUT framework for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project (Godot game)
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS target, async scene loading for >100 nodes
**Constraints**: Scene-First Architecture, TDD mandatory, UI consistency with existing theme system
**Scale/Scope**: Single-player political simulation game, modular scene system with signal-based communication

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Scene-First Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Modifying existing character creation scenes, maintaining scene modularity and signal-based communication

**II. GDScript Standards**: ✅ PASS - All code will follow official GDScript style guide with explicit typing

**III. Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS - TDD mandatory using GUT framework, tests written before implementation

**IV. Performance-First Design**: ✅ PASS - 60 FPS target maintained, using efficient OptionButton nodes instead of complex UI

**V. UI Consistency**: ✅ PASS - Using existing theme system, maintaining visual hierarchy and interaction patterns

**VI. Documentation-First Development**: ✅ PASS - Will consult Context7 MCP for Godot 4.5 best practices before implementation

**Overall**: PASS - No constitutional violations identified

### Post-Design Constitution Re-check

**I. Scene-First Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Design maintains modular scene structure with clear interface contracts

**II. GDScript Standards**: ✅ PASS - All interface contracts follow GDScript style guide with explicit typing

**III. Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS - Quickstart provides comprehensive test scenarios for TDD implementation

**IV. Performance-First Design**: ✅ PASS - Resource-based design optimizes loading, performance targets defined

**V. UI Consistency**: ✅ PASS - Design extends existing theme system, maintains UI patterns

**VI. Documentation-First Development**: ✅ PASS - Contracts define clear interfaces, will use Context7 MCP for implementation

**Overall**: PASS - Design reinforces constitutional compliance

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Godot game with existing scene structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- PresetOptionInterface → contract test task [P]
- CharacterBackgroundPresetsInterface → contract test task [P]
- CharacterCreationInterfaceExtension → contract test task [P]
- PresetOption Resource → model creation task [P]
- CharacterBackgroundPresets Resource → model creation task [P]
- CharacterPartyCreation scene modification → UI implementation task
- Preset loading and selection logic → service implementation tasks
- Quickstart test scenarios → integration test tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Unit tests → Implementation → Integration tests
- Dependency order: Resources → Interfaces → Scene modifications → Logic integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where files are independent
- Scene modification depends on resource system completion

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focused on:
1. Resource system creation (PresetOption, CharacterBackgroundPresets)
2. UI modification (OptionButton integration, preview system)
3. Logic integration (selection handling, validation, save/load)
4. Testing (contract tests, integration scenarios from quickstart)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
