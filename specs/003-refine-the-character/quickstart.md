# Quickstart Guide: Character and Party Creation Presets

## Overview
This guide validates the character and party creation preset system implementation through step-by-step testing scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Godot 4.5 project loaded
- Coalition 150 project opened
- Character creation scenes accessible
- GUT test framework available

## Test Scenario 1: Preset Resource Loading

### Steps
1. Navigate to `res://assets/data/` directory
2. Verify `CharacterBackgroundPresets.tres` file exists
3. Double-click to open in Inspector
4. Verify resource contains exactly 10 preset options

### Expected Results
- Resource file loads without errors
- 10 preset options visible in Inspector
- Each preset has all required fields filled
- Exactly 2 presets marked as satirical
- Difficulty ratings range from 1-10

### Validation Commands
```gdscript
# Run from script editor or debug console
var presets = load("res://assets/data/CharacterBackgroundPresets.tres")
print("Preset count: ", presets.preset_options.size())
print("Satirical count: ", presets.get_satirical_presets().size())
print("Valid collection: ", presets.is_valid())
```

## Test Scenario 2: Character Creation UI Integration

### Steps
1. Run project and navigate to character creation
2. Verify party name field is free text input (LineEdit)
3. Verify party slogan field is free text input (LineEdit)
4. Verify character background is dropdown selection (OptionButton)
5. Click character background dropdown

### Expected Results
- Two LineEdit fields for party name and slogan
- One OptionButton for character background
- Dropdown shows 10 options sorted by difficulty (easiest first)
- Each option displays meaningful background name

### Manual Validation
- Type custom text in party name field ✓
- Type custom text in party slogan field ✓
- Cannot type in character background field ✓
- Can select from dropdown options ✓

## Test Scenario 3: Preset Selection and Preview

### Steps
1. In character creation screen, hover over background dropdown
2. Select first option (easiest difficulty)
3. Verify preview information displays
4. Select last option (hardest difficulty)
5. Verify preview updates

### Expected Results
- Difficulty label shows (e.g., "Easy", "Hard")
- Gameplay impact text displays below dropdown
- Preview updates immediately on selection
- Different presets show different difficulty/impact text

### UI Elements to Verify
- Difficulty label updates ✓
- Impact description updates ✓
- Selected option highlighted in dropdown ✓
- Preview text is readable and informative ✓

## Test Scenario 4: Form Validation

### Steps
1. Leave party name field empty
2. Leave party slogan field empty
3. Do not select any background preset
4. Attempt to proceed to next step
5. Fill in party name and slogan
6. Leave background unselected, try to proceed again
7. Select a background preset and proceed

### Expected Results
- Cannot proceed without party name and slogan
- Cannot proceed without background selection
- Appropriate error messages displayed
- Can proceed when all fields completed

### Error States to Test
- Empty party name ✓
- Empty party slogan ✓
- No background selected ✓
- All fields completed allows progression ✓

## Test Scenario 5: Data Persistence

### Steps
1. Complete character creation with:
   - Custom party name: "Test Party"
   - Custom party slogan: "Test Slogan"
   - Selected background preset (any option)
2. Save the game
3. Exit to main menu
4. Load the saved game
5. Navigate to character info screen

### Expected Results
- Party name displays as entered: "Test Party"
- Party slogan displays as entered: "Test Slogan"
- Character background shows selected preset text
- All data persists correctly across save/load

### Data Verification
```gdscript
# Check saved character data
var character = GameManager.get_current_character()
print("Party name: ", character.party_name)
print("Party slogan: ", character.party_slogan)
print("Background preset ID: ", character.selected_background_preset_id)
```

## Test Scenario 6: Political Balance Validation

### Steps
1. Open CharacterBackgroundPresets.tres in Inspector
2. Count presets by political alignment
3. Verify balance across Dutch political spectrum
4. Identify the 2 satirical options

### Expected Distribution
- Progressive options: ~2-3
- Conservative options: ~2-3
- Centrist options: ~2-3
- Satirical options: exactly 2
- Total: exactly 10

### Manual Review Checklist
- [ ] Left-wing perspectives represented
- [ ] Right-wing perspectives represented
- [ ] Center perspectives represented
- [ ] Satirical options are clearly humorous
- [ ] All backgrounds feel authentic to Dutch politics
- [ ] No offensive or inappropriate content

## Test Scenario 7: Accessibility and Usability

### Steps
1. Use keyboard navigation to navigate character creation
2. Tab through all form fields
3. Use arrow keys to navigate background dropdown
4. Select option with Enter key
5. Navigate with screen reader (if available)

### Expected Results
- All fields accessible via keyboard
- Tab order is logical (name → slogan → background)
- Dropdown navigable with arrow keys
- Selection possible with Enter/Space
- Focus indicators visible

### Accessibility Checklist
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast
- [ ] Clear error messages

## Performance Validation

### Load Time Test
1. Start game and measure time to character creation
2. Record dropdown population time
3. Test selection responsiveness

### Expected Performance
- Scene load: < 2 seconds
- Dropdown population: < 100ms
- Selection response: < 50ms
- Memory usage increase: < 5MB

### Performance Commands
```gdscript
# Measure preset loading time
var start_time = Time.get_time_dict_from_system()
var presets = load("res://assets/data/CharacterBackgroundPresets.tres")
var end_time = Time.get_time_dict_from_system()
print("Load time: ", end_time - start_time)
```

## Regression Testing

### Existing Functionality
- [ ] Main menu navigation unchanged
- [ ] Save/load system works for other game data
- [ ] Character data appears correctly in game
- [ ] No performance degradation in other scenes
- [ ] Theme consistency maintained

### Integration Points
- [ ] Scene transitions work normally
- [ ] Signal communication with other systems
- [ ] SceneManager integration intact
- [ ] GameManager character data access

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Dropdown appears empty
**Solution**: Check CharacterBackgroundPresets.tres file path and validity

### Issue: Preview not updating
**Solution**: Verify signal connections between OptionButton and preview labels

### Issue: Cannot proceed despite selections
**Solution**: Check validation logic and ensure all required fields detected

### Issue: Save data not persisting
**Solution**: Verify selected_background_preset_id is being saved to CharacterData

### Issue: Performance problems
**Solution**: Check for unnecessary resource reloading or signal emission loops
