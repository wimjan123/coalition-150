**Input**: User description: "Create a launch screen for a Dutch politics game. It should display the game's title, \"Coalition 150\", and transition to the main menu after loading."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Launch screen for Dutch politics game
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Game players
   → Actions: View title, wait for loading, transition to menu
   → Data: Game title "Coalition 150", loading progress
   → Constraints: Must transition after loading completion
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Loading duration and visual feedback marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: Launch game → See title → Wait for loading → Enter main menu
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Loading state, game assets
7. Run Review Checklist
   → One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] for loading duration
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with minor clarification)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable loading time before the system should show an error or timeout message? → A: 10 seconds - Moderate loading allowing for larger assets
- Q: What type of loading progress indicator should be displayed to users? → A: Progress bar - Shows percentage completion with a horizontal bar
- Q: When loading fails or times out, what should happen next? → A: Retry automatically - System attempts to load again without user input
- Q: What specific user interactions should be ignored during the loading process? → A: All keyboard and mouse input
- Q: What visual emphasis should the "Coalition 150" title have on the launch screen? → A: Large and centered - Prominent title in center of screen

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player of the Coalition 150 Dutch politics game, when I launch the application, I want to see an attractive title screen that displays the game's name while the game loads in the background, so that I have a clear indication the game is starting and know what game I'm playing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the game application is launched, **When** the loading process begins, **Then** the launch screen displays with "Coalition 150" title large and centered prominently
2. **Given** the launch screen is displayed, **When** game assets are loading in the background, **Then** the player sees visual indication of loading progress
3. **Given** all game assets have finished loading, **When** loading is complete, **Then** the screen automatically transitions to the main menu
4. **Given** the player is on the launch screen, **When** they wait without taking any action, **Then** the system automatically proceeds to the main menu after loading completion

### Edge Cases
- What happens when loading takes an unusually long time (>10 seconds)? → System automatically retries up to 3 times
- How does the system handle loading failures or corrupted assets? → Automatic retry mechanism with progress bar reset
- What occurs if the player tries to interact with the launch screen before loading completes? → All keyboard and mouse input is ignored until loading finishes

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display "Coalition 150" as large, centered, prominent title text on the launch screen
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a progress bar showing percentage completion while game assets are being loaded
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically transition to the main menu when loading is complete
- **FR-004**: Launch screen MUST be the first screen displayed when the game application starts
- **FR-005**: System MUST load all essential game assets during the launch screen display
- **FR-006**: Progress bar MUST show accurate percentage completion from 0% to 100%
- **FR-007**: Transition to main menu MUST occur without requiring user input
- **FR-008**: System MUST complete loading within 10 seconds or automatically retry loading process
- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically retry loading up to 3 times before showing permanent error message
- **FR-010**: System MUST ignore all keyboard and mouse input during loading process

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Game Assets**: Essential files, scenes, and resources required for gameplay that must be loaded during launch
- **Loading State**: Current progress and status of asset loading process
- **Launch Screen UI**: Visual elements including title display and loading indicators
