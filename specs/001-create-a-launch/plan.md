# Implementation Plan: Coalition 150 Launch Screen

**Branch**: `001-create-a-launch` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-a-launch/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a launch screen for Coalition 150 Dutch politics game that displays the game title prominently while loading essential assets. The screen will use a simple Godot scene structure with ColorRect background, centered Label for title, and progress bar for loading feedback. Automatic transition to main menu after 10-second timeout or loading completion, with fade-to-black transition effect.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: GDScript in Godot 4.5 stable engine
**Primary Dependencies**: Godot 4.5 engine, ColorRect, Label, Timer, ProgressBar controls
**Storage**: Scene files (.tscn), resource files (.tres) for UI themes
**Testing**: GUT (Godot Unit Test) framework for scene behavior testing
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single Godot game project
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS stable frame rate, <100ms scene loading time
**Constraints**: 10-second maximum loading timeout, progress bar accuracy requirement
**Scale/Scope**: Single launch screen scene, simple asset loading simulation

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Scene-First Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Launch screen will be self-contained scene with clear separation (UI scene for presentation, loading logic separate)

**II. GDScript Standards**: ✅ PASS - Will follow snake_case naming, explicit typing, max 20-line functions, @export_group for variables

**III. Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS - GUT framework tests will be written first for loading logic, timeout behavior, transition mechanisms

**IV. Performance-First Design**: ✅ PASS - 60 FPS target maintained, scene loading <100ms, object pooling not needed (single scene), profiler verification planned

**V. UI Consistency**: ✅ PASS - Will use Godot theme system for consistent styling, progress bar follows standard patterns, accessibility states included

**VI. Documentation-First Development**: ✅ PASS - Context7 MCP consulted for Godot 4.5 ColorRect, Label, Timer patterns before implementation

**Structure Decision**: Godot single-project structure with scene-based organization

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- LaunchScreenInterface.gd → launch screen scene creation + tests [P]
- AssetLoaderInterface.gd → asset loading service + tests [P]
- SceneManagerInterface.gd → scene transition service + tests [P]
- Each entity from data-model.md → GDScript implementation
- Quickstart validation → integration test tasks

**Godot-Specific Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: GUT test files before GDScript implementation
- Scene hierarchy: UI components → logic scripts → autoload services
- Dependencies: Autoloads → scenes → scene scripts
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (different .tscn/.gd files)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered Godot-specific tasks in tasks.md

**Godot Task Categories**:
1. **Setup**: Project structure, GUT configuration, theme resources
2. **Tests First**: Unit tests for all contracts and data models
3. **Core Services**: AssetLoader, SceneManager autoload scripts
4. **Scenes**: LaunchScreen.tscn, ProgressBar.tscn, FadeTransition.tscn
5. **Integration**: Scene connections, signal wiring, transition flow
6. **Polish**: Performance testing, quickstart validation, documentation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md created with architecture decisions
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md created
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only) - Ready for /tasks command
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS - All principles validated
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS - No violations in architecture
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved - All ambiguities from spec clarified
- [x] Complexity deviations documented - No complexity violations identified
