# Research & Architecture Decisions: Coalition 150 Launch Screen

## Scene Architecture Research

### Decision: Control-based UI Structure
**Rationale**: Based on Godot 4.5 documentation via Context7 MCP, Control nodes provide better UI layout management and theme integration compared to Node2D approach.

**Implementation**:
- Root: Control node for screen-relative positioning
- Background: ColorRect for solid color background
- Title: Label with large, centered text
- Progress: ProgressBar with percentage display
- Timer: Timer node for timeout management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Node2D-based approach: Rejected due to lack of UI theme integration
- Canvas-based rendering: Overkill for simple launch screen

### Decision: Signal-based Communication Pattern
**Rationale**: Godot's signal system provides loose coupling between loading logic and UI updates, following Scene-First Architecture principle.

**Implementation**:
- AssetLoader emits `progress_updated(percentage: float)`
- AssetLoader emits `loading_completed()`
- LaunchScreen connects to these signals for UI updates
- SceneManager handles scene transitions via signals

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct method calls: Rejected due to tight coupling
- Global state polling: Rejected due to performance concerns

## Loading Simulation Research

### Decision: ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request() Pattern
**Rationale**: Context7 MCP documentation shows this as the recommended approach for non-blocking asset loading in Godot 4.5.

**Implementation**:
```gdscript
# Pseudo-code based on Godot 4.5 patterns
func simulate_loading():
    var assets_to_load = ["res://scenes/main/MainMenu.tscn", "res://assets/fonts/game_font.ttf"]
    for asset in assets_to_load:
        ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request(asset)
    # Progress monitoring with Timer updates
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous loading with yield: Deprecated in Godot 4.x
- Manual threading: Unnecessary complexity for asset loading

## Transition Effect Research

### Decision: Tween-based Fade Transition
**Rationale**: Godot 4.5 Tween class provides smooth animation control with built-in easing functions.

**Implementation**:
- CanvasLayer with ColorRect as fade overlay
- Tween animates modulate.a from 0.0 to 1.0 for fade-out
- Signal completion triggers scene change
- Reverse tween for fade-in at destination

**Alternatives considered**:
- AnimationPlayer: Overkill for simple fade effect
- Shader-based transition: Unnecessary complexity

## Progress Bar Accuracy Research

### Decision: Simulated Progress with Real Asset Tracking
**Rationale**: Provides user feedback while maintaining loading accuracy requirements from spec.

**Implementation**:
- Track actual loaded assets vs total assets
- Update progress bar in increments (0% to 100%)
- Validate against 10-second timeout requirement
- Use Timer.timeout for retry mechanism

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fake progress animation: Rejected due to accuracy requirement
- Real-time file system monitoring: Too complex for initial implementation

## Error Handling & Retry Research

### Decision: Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff
**Rationale**: Graceful degradation approach following clarification requirements for automatic retry.

**Implementation**:
- 3 retry attempts maximum
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays
- Progress bar resets on retry
- Final failure shows error message after all retries

**Alternatives considered**:
- Immediate retry: Poor user experience
- Manual retry button: Contradicts automatic requirement

## Theme Integration Research

### Decision: Resource-based Theme System
**Rationale**: Context7 MCP shows .tres theme files as best practice for consistent UI styling in Godot 4.5.

**Implementation**:
- Single ui_theme.tres file for all UI elements
- Label uses theme's default_font and title_font_size
- ProgressBar uses theme's progress_bar_style
- ColorRect uses theme's background_color

**Alternatives considered**:
- Inline styling: Poor maintainability
- Code-based theming: Not following UI Consistency principle

## Performance Optimization Research

### Decision: Minimal Scene Complexity
**Rationale**: Single scene with <10 nodes meets <100ms loading requirement.

**Implementation**:
- LaunchScreen scene: 6 nodes maximum
- No complex shaders or particles
- Pre-loaded font resources
- Godot's built-in profiler integration for validation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complex animated background: Rejected for performance
- Multiple subscenes: Unnecessary complexity

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: GUT Framework with Scene Testing
**Rationale**: GUT provides comprehensive testing for Godot scenes and GDScript logic.

**Implementation**:
- Unit tests for each component behavior
- Integration tests for complete launch flow
- Timeout behavior verification
- Progress bar accuracy validation
- Scene transition verification

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Violates TDD principle
- Custom testing framework: Unnecessary reinvention
