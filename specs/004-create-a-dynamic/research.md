# Research: Dynamic and Branching Interview System

## Research Findings

### JSON Parsing in Godot 4.5
**Decision**: Use Godot's built-in JSON.parse_string() for runtime parsing
**Rationale**:
- Native Godot function optimized for performance
- Direct conversion to Dictionary for fast lookups
- Error handling built-in for malformed JSON
- No external dependencies required

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom JSON parser: Too much overhead
- Resource files (.tres): Less flexible for runtime modification
- XML format: More verbose and slower to parse

### Interview State Management
**Decision**: Implement InterviewManager as autoload singleton
**Rationale**:
- Godot autoloads provide global access pattern
- Maintains state across scene transitions
- Enables modular architecture with clear separation
- Consistent with existing project patterns (CharacterBackgroundPresets.tres)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Scene-local state: Would lose state on scene changes
- Static variables: Not recommended in Godot architecture
- Event bus pattern: Overkill for simple state management

### Dynamic UI Updates
**Decision**: Use Godot's built-in Control nodes (Label, Button) with dynamic content
**Rationale**:
- Native Godot UI controls for optimal performance
- Built-in theming support for consistent styling
- Signal-based interaction pattern
- Accessibility features included

**Alternatives considered**:
- RichTextLabel: Unnecessary formatting complexity
- Custom UI controls: Development overhead without benefit
- HTML-based UI: Not supported in Godot

### Question Filtering and Priority
**Decision**: Implement tag-based matching with fallback system
**Rationale**:
- Flexible matching system for character/party presets
- Graceful degradation with generic questions
- Extensible for future preset types
- Clear priority hierarchy

**Alternatives considered**:
- Exact preset matching only: Too rigid, fails without fallback
- Random selection: Doesn't respect player choices
- Weighted scoring: Unnecessary complexity for initial version

### Game Effects System
**Decision**: Implement effects as structured data with immediate application
**Rationale**:
- Simple key-value pairs for stats/flags
- Immediate feedback to player
- Easy to extend for new effect types
- Integrates with existing game state system

**Alternatives considered**:
- Delayed effect application: Poor user feedback
- Script-based effects: Security risk, complexity
- Complex effect system: YAGNI for current requirements

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Use GUT framework with scene-based integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with constitutional TDD requirement
- Scene testing capabilities for UI validation
- Mock support for JSON file testing
- Established in project constitution

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Violates constitutional requirements
- Custom test framework: Reinventing the wheel
- Unit tests only: Insufficient for scene interactions

## Technical Patterns Identified

### Godot 4.5 Best Practices
- Scene instantiation with `load()` and `instantiate()`
- Signal connections using `connect()` method
- Resource management with `load()` for JSON files
- Type safety with explicit GDScript typing
- Error handling with `if` conditions and early returns

### Performance Considerations
- Parse JSON once at scene initialization
- Use Dictionary lookup for O(1) question access
- Minimize UI node creation/destruction
- Cache frequently accessed data structures
- Implement object pooling if needed for large datasets

### Memory Management
- Preload interview data to avoid runtime I/O
- Use `queue_free()` for proper node cleanup
- Clear unused references to prevent memory leaks
- Monitor memory usage with Godot profiler

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- Character creation system (preset data access)
- Party creation system (preset data access)
- Game state management (effect application)
- Scene transition system (interview completion)

### Data Flow
1. Player completes character/party creation
2. Interview scene loads with player preset data
3. InterviewManager filters questions based on presets
4. Player progresses through branching dialogue
5. Effects applied to game state
6. Interview completion triggers scene transition
