# Feature Specification: Dynamic and Branching Interview System

**Feature Branch**: `004-create-a-dynamic`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a dynamic and branching interview system. The system must load interview questions and answers from an external 'interviews.json' file. Questions should be dynamically selected, prioritizing those matching the player's chosen character and party presets. Furthermore, the selection of the *next* question must be conditional, based on the player's *previous answer*, allowing for interactive dialogue paths. The interview scene will display one question at a time and allow the player to select from a list of predefined answers, which will also trigger specific game effects."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: When no questions match the player's character and party presets, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Show generic fallback questions that work for any preset
- Q: How should the system validate the interviews.json file? ‚Üí A: Full content validation including question IDs and branching logic
- Q: When should the interview system end and allow the player to proceed? ‚Üí A: After a fixed number of questions (5-10 questions maximum)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A player who has completed character and party creation enters an interview phase where they answer questions tailored to their selections. Based on their responses, the interview branches dynamically, leading to different subsequent questions. Each answer affects the game state and unlocks specific story paths or character development.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a player has selected character and party presets, **When** they enter the interview scene, **Then** questions relevant to their selections are prioritized and displayed
2. **Given** a player answers a question, **When** the system processes their response, **Then** the next question is selected based on their previous answer and game effects are applied
3. **Given** a player is progressing through the interview, **When** they reach a branching point, **Then** only appropriate follow-up questions matching their answer path are available
4. **Given** the interview system loads, **When** it reads the external data file, **Then** all questions, answers, conditions, and effects are properly imported
5. **Given** a player selects an answer, **When** the system processes it, **Then** any associated game effects (stats, flags, unlocks) are immediately applied

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the interviews.json file is missing or corrupted?
- How does the system handle when no questions match the player's presets?
- What occurs if a branching condition references a non-existent answer or question?
- How does the system behave when all available question paths have been exhausted?
- How does the system handle validation failures in interviews.json (malformed JSON, missing references, invalid schema)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST load interview data from an external 'interviews.json' file at runtime
- **FR-002**: System MUST prioritize questions that match the player's selected character preset
- **FR-003**: System MUST prioritize questions that match the player's selected party preset
- **FR-004**: System MUST select the next question based on the player's previous answer choice
- **FR-005**: System MUST display one question at a time with its associated answer options
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow players to select from predefined answer choices only
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply game effects immediately when an answer is selected
- **FR-008**: System MUST support branching dialogue paths where different answers lead to different subsequent questions
- **FR-009**: System MUST track the player's interview progress and answer history
- **FR-010**: System MUST display generic fallback questions when no questions match the player's character and party presets
- **FR-011**: System MUST perform full content validation of interview data including question IDs, branching logic integrity, and reference consistency. On validation failure, system MUST log specific errors and fall back to generic interview questions
- **FR-012**: System MUST end the interview after a fixed number of questions (5-10 maximum) and proceed to the next game phase

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Interview Question**: Contains question text, associated presets for matching, answer options, and branching conditions
- **Answer Choice**: Contains answer text, game effects to apply, and conditions for next question selection
- **Interview Session**: Tracks current question, answer history, applied effects, and progress state
- **Interview Data**: External configuration containing all questions, answers, branching logic, and game effects
- **Game Effects**: Modifications to player stats, story flags, unlocks, or other game state changes triggered by answers
