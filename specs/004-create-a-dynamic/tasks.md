# Tasks: Dynamic and Branching Interview System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-create-a-dynamic/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: GDScript 2.0 (Godot 4.5), GUT framework
   → Structure: Scene-first architecture, autoload singleton
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: InterviewQuestion, AnswerChoice, InterviewSession, InterviewData, GameEffects
   → contracts/: interview-manager-api.gd, interview-scene-api.gd, json-schema.json
   → quickstart.md: Test scenarios and validation requirements
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Interview data file, GUT test configuration
   → Tests: JSON validation, contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: InterviewManager autoload, InterviewScene implementation
   → Integration: Preset system connection, game state effects
   → Polish: Performance validation, scene transitions
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → TDD: Tests before implementation
5. Validation: All contracts tested, all entities implemented
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Godot project**: `res://` root, `scenes/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`
- Following scene-first architecture with autoload singletons

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [x] T001 Create sample interview data file `res://interviews.json` with validation test cases
- [x] T002 Configure GUT testing framework for interview system tests
- [x] T003 [P] Create test data structure in `tests/data/` for mock interview scenarios

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

### JSON Schema and Data Validation Tests
- [x] T004 [P] JSON schema validation test in `tests/test_json_validation.gd` - validates interviews.json structure
- [x] T005 [P] Interview data loading test in `tests/test_data_loading.gd` - tests malformed JSON handling
- [x] T006 [P] Question reference validation test in `tests/test_question_references.gd` - validates next_question_id links

### InterviewManager Contract Tests
- [x] T007 [P] InterviewManager autoload test in `tests/test_interview_manager_contract.gd` - tests singleton API
- [x] T008 [P] Question filtering test in `tests/test_question_filtering.gd` - tests preset tag matching

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### Data Models and Validation

- [ ] T048 [P] Manual testing validation using `quickstart.md` test scenarios
- [ ] T049 Remove debug code and temporary logging statements
- [ ] T050 Final integration test - complete character creation to interview to next phase flow

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- Setup (T001-T003) → All other tasks
- JSON/Data tests (T004-T006) → Data models (T017-T021) → InterviewManager core (T022-T027)
- Contract tests (T007-T013) → Scene implementation (T028-T033)
- Integration tests (T014-T016) → System integration (T034-T039)
- Core implementation (T017-T039) → Polish (T040-T050)

### Blocking Relationships
- T022 (InterviewManager core) blocks T023-T027, T034-T036, T038
- T028 (Scene structure) blocks T029-T033
- T034-T036 (integrations) block T038-T039 (autoload config)
- All implementation blocks polish tasks (T040-T050)

## Parallel Example

### Phase 3.2 - All Test Creation (Run Together)
```bash
# JSON and data validation tests:
Task: "JSON schema validation test in tests/test_json_validation.gd"
Task: "Interview data loading test in tests/test_data_loading.gd"
Task: "Question reference validation test in tests/test_question_references.gd"

# Contract tests:
Task: "InterviewManager autoload test in tests/test_interview_manager_contract.gd"
Task: "Question filtering test in tests/test_question_filtering.gd"
Task: "Scene UI update test in tests/test_scene_ui_updates.gd"
Task: "User interaction test in tests/test_user_interactions.gd"

# Integration tests:

Task: "Preset integration test in tests/integration/test_preset_integration.gd"
Task: "Fallback question test in tests/integration/test_fallback_handling.gd"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Data Models (Run Together After Tests Fail)

# All data model classes (independent files):
Task: "InterviewQuestion data class in scripts/models/interview_question.gd"
Task: "AnswerChoice data class in scripts/models/answer_choice.gd"
Task: "InterviewSession data class in scripts/models/interview_session.gd"
Task: "InterviewData validator in scripts/models/interview_data.gd"
Task: "GameEffects data class in scripts/models/game_effects.gd"
```

### Phase 3.5 - Polish Tasks (Run Together After Core Complete)
```bash
# Performance and validation (independent):
Task: "Performance validation test in tests/performance/test_interview_performance.gd"
Task: "Memory management test in tests/performance/test_memory_usage.gd"
Task: "Error recovery test in tests/edge_cases/test_error_recovery.gd"
Task: "Code documentation review - ensure GDScript docstrings and type hints"
```

## Notes

### TDD Requirements
- All tests in Phase 3.2 MUST be written first and MUST fail before implementation
- Follow red-green-refactor cycle per constitutional requirements
- Use GUT framework for all testing with explicit GDScript typing

### Godot-Specific Considerations
- Scene-first architecture: InterviewScene is self-contained and independently testable
- Autoload singleton pattern for InterviewManager following Godot conventions
- Resource file integration with existing .tres preset system
- Signal-based communication between InterviewManager and InterviewScene
- Performance target: 60 FPS with <16ms UI updates, <100ms scene transitions

### File Organization
- `scripts/models/` - Data classes and validation logic
- `scripts/` - Core implementation (InterviewManager.gd, InterviewScene.gd)
- `scenes/` - UI scenes (InterviewScene.tscn)
- `tests/` - All test files organized by type
- `res://interviews.json` - Sample interview data

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - interview-manager-api.gd → T007-T010 contract tests → T022-T027 implementation
   - interview-scene-api.gd → T011-T013 contract tests → T028-T033 implementation
   - json-schema.json → T004-T006 validation tests → T017-T021 data models

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity (InterviewQuestion, AnswerChoice, InterviewSession, InterviewData, GameEffects) → model task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer in InterviewManager

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Each validation scenario → integration test [P] (T014-T016)
   - Performance requirements → performance validation tasks (T040-T043)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T016)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T017-T021)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 → Phase 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared state)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD workflow enforced (tests must fail before implementation)
- [x] Godot constitutional requirements addressed (scene-first, autoload, GUT testing)
